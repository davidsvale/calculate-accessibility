# calculate-accessibility
Python script to calculate accessibility (gravity and cumulative opportunities) from OD matrix.

## A bit of theory

## Input files:
1) OD Matrix (csv file), with three columns: Origin, Destination, CostofTravel (column names are irrelevant, as long as they are in this order)
2) Data for opportunities found at destination (e.g. jobs at each location)
